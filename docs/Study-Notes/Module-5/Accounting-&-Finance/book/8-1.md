# 8-1 Portfolio Theory and CAPM

## Portfolio Theory

Harry Markowitz explained how to reduce the
*standard deviation* of a portfolio by choosing
stocks that do not move together. He also wrote the principles of portfolio construction.

when measured over a short interval, the past rates of return on any stock conform closely to a normal distribution.

normal distributions can be completely defined by two numbers:
+ the average or expected value.
+ the variance or standard deviation.
